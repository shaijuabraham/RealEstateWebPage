This project involves creating at least two separate ASP.NET Core RESTful Web APIs, each focused on a highly cohesive set of functions, adhering to REST principles by implementing HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations. The APIs must handle custom user-defined data types (classes) and exchange data using JSON or XML,avoiding reliance on simple data types like strings or integers for every method.The APIs should support flexible input formats, allowing developers to send both form data and complex objects. The Razor Views in the Web application must include server-side code to consume these APIs through Web requests, avoiding the use of client-side AJAX for communication. This ensures the integration of APIs into the server-side logic of the web application.The Real Estate Application System allows realtors to manage property listings through their individual accounts. Each agent can add, remove, and update property details specific to their listings. Users can search for properties by location, view detailed property information, schedule visits, and make offers directly through the platform. The homepage offers a streamlined search feature, making it easy for users to find and explore properties based on location.
